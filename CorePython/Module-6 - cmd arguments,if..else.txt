Command Line Arguments: 
-----------------------
While running program arguments which are passing through commnd line
are called as command line arguments .

Here arguments are separated by space.

>> python add.py 10 20

* These argumens are stored by default in the form of strings in a list with name argv.
  this is available in sys module.

argv[0] --> add.py
10  	--> 10
20		--> 20

cmnd_line.py
===============

import sys

a = int(sys.argv[1])
b = int(sys.argv[2])

print(type(a))
print(type(b))

add = a + b
print(add)

NOTE : default it will take string so we have convert to integer

execution : 

C:\Users\welcome\Desktop>python cmnd_line.py 10 20


Control statments(if..elif..else)
============================

 If any statment expecting its sub statements then it should be ended with : 

conditional execution :

if x > 0 :
    print('x is positive')
	
Alternative execution : 

if x%2 == 0 :
    print('x is even')
else :
    print('x is odd')

Chained conditionals :

if x < y:
    print 'x is less than y'
elif x > y:
    print 'x is greater than y'
else:
    print 'x and y are equal'
